# Day 1: Intro to Cybersecurity, Basic Command Line and Linux Essentials

Welcome to Day 1, today's topic re/introduces you to cybersecurity and teaches essential command line and Linux skills

Cybersecurity is like a digital bodyguard for your computer, smartphone, and the information you store on them. It's a set of practices and technologies designed to protect your devices, data, and networks from digital threats and bad actors, as hackers and viruses.

Imagine your computer as a house, and cybersecurity is the lock on the door, the alarm system, and the guards who keep watch to ensure no one breaks in or steals your valuable stuff. It involves things like using strong passwords, keeping your software up-to-date, and being cautious about what you click on or download online.

In simple terms, cybersecurity is all about keeping your digital world safe from online bad guys and making sure your information stays private and secure.
Linux is the most used operating system when it comes to testing and practising cybersecurity.  

Linux is an operating system, just like Windows or macOS. It's the software that manages your computer's hardware and lets you run programs and applications. What sets Linux apart is that it's open-source, meaning it's freely available for anyone to use and modify. It's known for its stability, security, and flexibility. Linux comes in various "flavors" called distributions (or distros), each with its own features and design. It's widely used in servers, supercomputers, and even on everyday desktops because of its reliability and customization options.
