level 0 -> level 1
-------
Login using: ssh leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223

Look around using "ls -la" you'll notice a .backup file that belongs to leviathan1 but you have the permissions to read, 
"cd .backup"
Try to find a password in the file 
"cat backup.html | grep passwd"

Password found:: PPIfmI1qsA

Level 1 -> Level 2
--------

login using: ssh leviathan1@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
Look around: "ls -la"
test out 'check': "./check"
use ltrace to see what library calls are made during execution: "ltrace ./check" 
You'll find the password in the strcmp: pass== sex
 run the binary again and use the right password."./check"
"cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2" to get the next password

Password Found:: mEh5PNl10e

Level 2 -> Level 3
---------

Login using: ssh leviathan2@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
"ls -la"
"ltrace ./printfile" to see how it works
You'll notice that the program reads a file after checking the file name.
The program however does not completely read the file name if it has spaces. We can take advantage of this by making 2 files
one named: "/tmp/flag"
second named: "/tmp/flag me.txt"
We'll then link the first to the file we wanna read:"ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 /tmp/flag"
After this, we'll run the program "./printfile /tmp/"flag me.txt"

Level 3 -> Level 4 
--------
login using: ssh leviathan3@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223

Use the same tactic used on level 2

Password Found: AgvropI4OA

Level4 -> Level 5 
---------
login using: ssh leviathan4@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223

Take the given binary and change it to ascii using a tool of your choosing or use a script
Password Found: EKKlTF1Xqs

Level 5 -> Level 6
---------
login using: ssh leviathan5@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223

Link the /tmp/file.log with the file you want to read:"ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log" the run the executable file
Password Found: YZ55XPVk2l

Level 6 -> Level 7
----------
login using: ssh leviathan6@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223

There are several ways to solve this one, I used a script to bruteforce the 4 digit code
Scrpt used:"for i in {0000..9999}; do ./leviathan6 $i; done"
